Official PyTorch Repository of "Difficulty-Aware Simulator for Open Set Recognition" (ECCV 2022 Paper)

## 1. Requirements
- python 3.6+
- torch 1.2+
- torchvision 0.4+
- CUDA 10.1+
- scikit-learn 0.22+

### Split information & Dataset

Split information for all datasets can be found in `split.py`.

`splits_F1` and `splits_AUROC` are split information for each benchmark with F1 score and AUROC.

When you run the code, datasets except tiny-ImageNet will be automatically downloaded.

## 2. Training & Evaluation
```train
python osr.py --dataset 'cifar10'
```
To run the code, execute `osr.py`.
Then, the results will be saved under the "logs" directory.

```
sh osr.sh
```
For simplicity, we provide the training scripts for running all datasets.
You can execute the shell file by the above command. 


++ Since [Open-Set Recognition: a Good Closed-Set Classifier is All You Need?] elaborated additional techniques with searched hyperparameters can boost OSR performances, we here simply conduct and compare the performances of DIAS and ARPL+cs.

| Tiny-ImageNet | 800 epochs training |
| ------------- |:-----:|
| ARPL+cs       | 71.9  |
| DIAS (Ours)   | 75.6  |
